 PERTH LIVING - PREDICTIVE MODELING USING MACHINE LEARNING

Goal: The project aims to predict the rent prices in Perth using a machine learning algorithm (linear regression model) trained with historic rental price data.

Description of the Dataset:
The dataset studied would be the Perth House prices (from Kaggle) which originally has 33656 rows and 19 columns. 
 Some of the columns are mentioned below 
 ['ADDRESS', 'SUBURB', 'NEAREST_STN', 'DATE_SOLD', 'NEAREST_SCH'], dtype='object')



Hypothesis:
"There exists a set of varied factors that significantly impact the prices of houses in Perth. We hypothesize that features like location, size, number of bedrooms, amenities, and economic indicators play a crucial role in determining the price of houses in the city. Through a linear regression predictive model, we aim to develop a reliable algorithm that accurately forecasts house prices based on the discovered key variables."

Problem Statement:
How can we assist homebuyers and realtors in making informed decisions regarding real estate transactions by using a Linear Regression model trained with the help of a comprehensive dataset that explores various spatial, logistic, and geosocial features of houses in the area?
